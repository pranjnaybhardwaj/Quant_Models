"""# Football Score Simulator using Poisson Model

This project simulates football match outcomes using the Poisson distribution based on historical data.

## Features
- Predict goals scored by each team using a statistical model
- Generate score matrices
- Visualize probabilities for match outcomes

## How It Works
- Each team's average goal scoring and conceding rate is calculated.
- The Poisson distribution is used to model goal scoring probabilities.
- Match outcomes are simulated using these probabilities.
